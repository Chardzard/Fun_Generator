; Program Description: Prompts user for number then prompts user			 ;
;					   to choose from four options: Fibonacci,				 ;
;					   Exchange Elements, Sum Gaps, & Shift Elements.		 ;
;					   Each of these functions will be explaied in			 ;
;					   their own documentation to follow in the code,		 ;
;					   but each function will use that intial number		 ;
;					   taken from the user's first input in their processing ;

; Function:	Shift Elements functionality of program. Using our 'N' element array,	;
;			we prompt the user for a shift value between 1 & 47, as 0 would be no   ;
;			shift & 48 would shift all vals the full length of the array, resulting ;
;			in the same array as the original										;
;																					;
; Return: Array shifted by 'M' elements, as specified by user from input			;
;																					;
; Procedure: Set ESI & EDI to original and shifted array offsets, set ECX to value  ;
;			 from user input using var 'shift_val'. Perform calculations to set the ;
;			 'shift_val_bytes' var to the amount of bytes we need to travel up in   ;
;			 memory. Add that many bytes to pointer in memory, then subtract the    ;
;			 val taken from user input multiplied by 4 since we are handling 32-bit ;
;			 vars and registers. This will now give us a pointer to the val that    ;
;			 will be set first in the shifted array. We then increment all pointers ;
;			 and continue for as many vals as was specified by user from input.		;
;			 Finally, we resume proc at the index pointed to by EDI & shift this    ;
;			 val into the next array sequence. We do this for as many iterations as ;
;			 specified by user from input, represented by the 'shift_val' var. We   ;
;			 finally finish off by printing our newly shifted array to the console  ;
;			 for our end user														;
